# img-cmp
This will hopefully help with identifying and removing similar images in a large library.

## What does it do?
I planned this project to give a list of the n image pairs that are the most similar to each other,
then save it in a cache file, additionally, there is now an option to rename files in a library to
their respective sha-1 hash (I thought it would be nice to have a consistent naming scheme).
